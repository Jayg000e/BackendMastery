# RabbitMQ Tutorial 

This section of the BackendMastery repository demonstrates the integration of RabbitMQ in Node.js applications, specifically focusing on user registration and email notification services.

## Overview

- `registrationServer.js`: Implements a server for user registration. When a user registers, it sends a message to a RabbitMQ queue. 
- `emailService.js`: Listens to the RabbitMQ queue and processes incoming messages to simulate sending emails.


## Running the Examples

1. **Email Service (Consumer)**
   
   Open a terminal and navigate to the RabbitMQ folder:
   ```bash
   cd RabbitMQ
   ```

   Start the email service:

   ```bash
   node emailService.js
   ```
   
This service listens to the RabbitMQ queue and will process messages representing user registrations.

2. **Registration Server (Producer)**
   
   
   Start the registration server:
   
   ```bash
   node registrationServer.js
   ```

   This server handles user registration and sends messages to the RabbitMQ queue.

3. **Testing the Workflow**
   
   
- Register a User: Send a POST request to http://localhost:3000/register with a JSON payload containing user details. You can use tools like curl or Postman for this. For example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "name": "John Doe"}'
```

- Observe Email Service Output: After sending the registration request, check the terminal running the emailService.js. You should see a log indicating that an email is being sent to the registered user's email address.

## Explanation of the Code

- registrationServer.js: This server sets up an Express application to handle HTTP POST requests for user registration. Upon receiving a registration request, it sends a message to the RabbitMQ queue with the user's details.
- emailService.js: This service continuously listens to the RabbitMQ queue. When it receives a message, it simulates sending an email by logging the action to the console.
- By running both registrationServer.js and emailService.js, you can see the asynchronous communication between two separate processes using RabbitMQ.

# Redis Leaderboard Tutorial

This section of the BackendMastery repository focuses on using Redis with Node.js to create a leaderboard system. The application demonstrates how to add scores for users, retrieve top scores, and get user rankings.

## Overview

The Redis tutorial consists of an Express server that interfaces with Redis to manage a game leaderboard. It includes endpoints to add user scores, retrieve the top scores, and find a specific user's rank.

## Running the Server

1. **Navigate to the Redis Folder**:

   ```bash
   cd Redis
   ```

2. **Start the Server**:

```bash
node server.js
```
## Redis Operations
The server uses Redis sorted sets for efficient score management and ranking:

- addScore: Adds or updates a score for a user.
- getTopScores: Retrieves the top N scores.
- getUserRank: Finds the ranking of a specific user.

Redis sorted sets are ideal for this kind of application due to their performance characteristics and suitability for storing and retrieving ordered data.

## Conclusion

This tutorial showcases a practical implementation of Redis for managing a leaderboard in a gaming context. The use of Redis is particularly apt here due to its efficient data structures and speedy performance. Notably, for gaming applications where leaderboards do not necessarily require long-term data persistence, Redis offers an ideal solution. Its ability to handle high-speed transactions and temporary data storage aligns perfectly with the dynamic nature of gaming leaderboards. This example serves as an excellent demonstration of integrating Redis with a Node.js backend to achieve real-time, high-performance data handling in a situation where immediate, but not permanent, data storage is key.

# Elasticsearch Blogging Platform Tutorial

This section of the BackendMastery repository demonstrates the integration of Elasticsearch with Node.js for building a blogging platform. The application showcases creating blog posts, performing full-text searches, filtering by categories, and querying posts within a date range.

## Overview

Elasticsearch is utilized for its powerful full-text search capabilities, allowing for efficient searching, filtering, and sorting of blog posts based on various criteria.

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cd ElasticSearch
node server.js
```
This command will start the Express server, interfacing with Elasticsearch on http://localhost:9200.

### Usage

#### Create a Blog Post

- **Endpoint**: POST /blog-posts
- **Function**: Adds a new blog post to the Elasticsearch index.
- **Usage**:
  Use the following curl command to create a new post:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/blog-posts -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "My First Post", "content": "This is an amazing post about Elasticsearch.", "categories": ["Elasticsearch", "Search"], "date_published": "2023-01-01"}'
  ```
#### Full-Text Search in Blog Posts

- **Endpoint**: GET /search
- **Function**: Performs a full-text search across blog post titles and content.
- **Usage**:
  Use the following curl command for full-text search:

  ```bash
  curl "http://localhost:3000/search?q=Elasticsearch"
  ```
#### Filter Posts by Category

- **Endpoint**: GET /posts/category
- **Function**: Filters blog posts by a specific category.
- **Usage**:
  Use the following curl command to filter posts:
  ```
  curl "http://localhost:3000/posts/category?category=Elasticsearch"
  ```
#### Search Posts by Date Range

- **Endpoint**: GET /posts/date-range
- **Function**: Finds posts published within a specified date range.
- **Usage**:
  Use the following curl command to search by date range:
  ```
  curl "http://localhost:3000/posts/date-range?start=2023-01-01&end=2023-12-31"
  ```
### Elasticsearch Operations

The server utilizes Elasticsearch for:

- createBlogPost: Indexes a new blog post.
- searchBlogPosts: Retrieves posts based on a text search.
- filterPostsByCategory: Gets posts from a specific category.
- searchPostsByDateRange: Finds posts within a date range.

Elasticsearch's capabilities make it ideal for these types of data-rich, search-intensive applications.

### Conclusion

This tutorial illustrates a practical implementation of Elasticsearch in a blogging platform, demonstrating how to leverage its full-text search and data querying capabilities in a Node.js backend application.
